## Readme File of the `kugelpunk\kugelpunk.github.io` Repo

### Intro
This is a GitHub Pages repo for https://kugelpunk.github.io (a username website). This readme file contains mainly content from GitHub, which might help the repo user.
readme files can be written in plain text, [reStructured Text](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) or [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). They should include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.

### GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages allows to create a website using the code that lives in your GitHub repositories. (Appearantly it simply provides a webserver for your HTML and its endpoints.) GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when creating new repositories in the future, the steps to launch a GitHub Pages website will be slightly different.

### How to Publish the Website
We've already set-up a GitHub Pages website for you, based on your personal username. This repository is called `hello-world`, but you'll rename it to: `username.github.io`, to match your website's URL address.

To get started:

Under the **Repository Name** heading, type: `kugelpunk.github.io`.

Once you click **Rename**, your website will automatically be published at: https://kugelpunk.github.io/. The file—called `index.html`—is rendered as the home page.

### Practice: Customize your first GitHub website
Let’s start with this template:

```
<p>Hello World! I’m [username]. This is my website!</p>
```

Paste the template to line 15 and fill in the blanks.

When you’re done, scroll down to the `Commit changes` section near the bottom of the edit page. Add a short message explaining your change, like "Add my introduction", then click `Commit changes`.

Once you click `Commit changes`, your changes will automatically be published on your GitHub Pages website. Refresh the page to see your new changes live in action.

:tada: You just made your first commit! :tada:

### Image Selection
Change the placeholder Octocat gif on your GitHub Pages website by [creating your own personal Octocat emoji](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/) or [choose a different Octocat gif from our logo library here](https://octodex.github.com/). Add that image to line 12 of your `index.html` file, in place of the `<img src=` link.
